A Xamarin Forms responsive toolkit. It is currently in prerelease as we are testing it and improving it day by day. This toolkit is similar to what we get in Bootstrap. So if you are familier with Bootstrap you feel right at home with this toolkit.

Below are features already in the toolkit.
- Grid based responsive layout
- Responsive Master detail (very intresting)
- Responsive Tab
- Styles (primary, success, danger etc)
- Button style
- Label style
- Screen size based Visible-hidden processing
- Forms (basic, horizontal, and inline)
- Button groups (basic and justified)
- Input groups
