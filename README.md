A Xamarin Forms responsive toolkit. It is currently in pre-release as we are testing it and improving it day by day. This toolkit is similar to what we get in Bootstrap. So if you are familiar with Bootstrap you feel right at home with this toolkit.

### Below are features already in the toolkit.

* Grid System(A grid based responsive layout)
* Responsive Master detail (very interesting)
* Responsive Tab
* Styles (primary, success, danger etc)` 
* Button Style
* Label Style
* Screen size based Visible-hidden processing
* Forms (basic, horizontal, and inline)
* Button groups (basic and justified)
* Input groups
